Several presentations in this folder are in the form of [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebooks. To run a notebook, [install Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and the [Pluto.jl package](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl). Once you start one of the notebooks inside of pluto, the rest of the required packages will be automatically installed. The notebook [`juliacon_2022_mtk.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaControl/ControlExamples.jl/blob/master/presentations/juliacon_2022_mtk.jl) is an exception to this automatic package installation by Pluto, since it relies on a development version of [Kroki.jl](https://github.com/bauglir/Kroki.jl) that draws block diagrams. This notebook requires you to manually install all packages that are loaded inside the notebook. Once Kroki.jl makes a new release with the required updates, this procedure will be simplified.

The presentaitons are:
- [`juliacon_2022.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaControl/ControlExamples.jl/blob/master/presentations/juliacon_2022.jl): The main presentation for Juliacon 2022.
- [`juliacon_2022_mtk.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaControl/ControlExamples.jl/blob/master/presentations/juliacon_2022_mtk.jl): ControlSystems and ModelingToolkit interaction, presented at Juliacon 2022
- [`julia_munich_control_presentation.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaControl/ControlExamples.jl/blob/master/presentations/julia_munich_control_presentation.jl): A presentation given at the Julia user group in Munich. [A video of the presentation is available here.](https://youtu.be/Fdz2Fsm1aTY)
